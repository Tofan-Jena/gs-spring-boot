# Maven Life Cycle : - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maven-lifecycle-and-basic-maven-commands/

* Maven Lifecycle: Below is a representation of the default Maven lifecycle and its 8 steps: Validate, Compile, Test, Package, Integration test, Verify, Install and Deploy.


The default Maven lifecycle consists of 8 major steps or phases for compiling, testing, building and installing a given Java project as specified below:

Validate: This step validates if the project structure is correct. For example – It checks if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are available in the local repository.
Compile: It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class and stores the classes in target/classes folder.
Test: It runs unit tests for the project.
Package: This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.
Integration test: It runs the integration tests for the project.
Verify: This step runs checks to verify that the project is valid and meets the quality standards.
Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.
Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers

Maven follows a sequential order to execute the commands where if you run step n, all steps preceding it (Step 1 to n-1) are also executed. For example – if we run the Installation step (Step 7), it will validate, compile, package and verify the project along with running unit and integration tests (Step 1 to 6) before installing the built package to the local repository.


# Maven Commands:

* mvn clean: Cleans the project and removes all files generated by the previous build.
* mvn compile: Compiles source code of the project.
* mvn test-compile: Compiles the test source code.
* mvn test: Runs tests for the project.
* mvn package: Creates JAR or WAR file for the project to convert it into a distributable format.
* mvn install: Deploys the packaged JAR/ WAR file to the local repository.
* mvn deploy: Copies the packaged JAR/ WAR file to the remote repository after compiling, running tests and building the project.
